                    employees with 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 year careers in the BC Public
                    Service. Long Service Award ceremonies are prestigious and memorable
                    events held at Government House in Victoria, the official residence of
                    B.C.'s Lieutenant Governor and the ceremonial home for all British
                    Columbians.

                    If youâ€™ve reached a career milestone of at least 5, 10, 15 or 20 years with the BC Public Service,
                    register now to receive a commemorative service pin. Note that Long Service Award recipients
                    automatically receive a corresponding service pin and do not need to register separately.
