          employees with 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 year careers in the BC Public
          Service. Long Service Award ceremonies are prestigious and memorable
          events held in Victoria this fall.

          If youâ€™ve reached a career milestone of at least 5, 10, 15 or 20 years
          with the BC Public Service, register now to receive a commemorative
