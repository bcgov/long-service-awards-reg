                  Calculate your years of service by counting the calendar
                  years youâ€™ve been working for an eligible organization,
                  including the year you started and the current year.{" "}

                  Time worked as a seasonal, co-op, part-time or auxiliary

                  Your service time is calculated based on cumulative service
                  time, rather than continuous.{" "}

                  That means any time worked prior to a break in service
                  counts towards your service time. Periods of leave with pay
                  (STIIP, maternity/parental leave, educational leave,
                  deferred salary leave, LTD up to a maximum of two years)
                  count towards years of service, but unpaid leave does not.
